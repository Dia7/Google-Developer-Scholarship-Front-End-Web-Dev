NASA's countdown to launch includes checkpoints where NASA engineers complete certain technical tasks. During the final minute, NASA has 6 tasks to complete:

&#8728; Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power (T-50 seconds)<br/>
&#8728; Ground launch sequencer is go for auto sequence start (T-31 seconds)<br/>
&#8728; Activate launch pad sound suppression system (T-16 seconds)<br/>
&#8728; Activate main engine hydrogen burnoff system (T-10 seconds)<br/>
&#8728; Main engine start (T-6 seconds)<br/>
&#8728; Solid rocket booster ignition and liftoff! (T-0 seconds)<br/>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> "T-50 seconds" read as "T-minus 50 seconds".<br/>

<h3>Directions:</h3>
Write a while loop that counts down from 60 seconds and:

&#8728; If there's a task being completed, it prints out the task<br/>
&#8728; If there is no task being completed, it prints out the time as T-x seconds<br/>

Use the task and time descriptions described above.
