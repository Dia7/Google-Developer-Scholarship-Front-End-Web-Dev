<h3>Directions:</h3>
Write a for loop that prints out the factorial of the number 12:

A <strong>factorial</strong> is calculated by multiplying a number by all the numbers below it. For instance, 3! or "3 factorial" is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

<blockquote>3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 3!=3∗2∗1=6<br/>
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 4!=4∗3∗2∗1=24<br/>
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 5!=5∗4∗3∗2∗1=120<br/></blockquote>

Save your final answer in a variable called solution and print it to the console.
