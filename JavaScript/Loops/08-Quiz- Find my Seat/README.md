<h3>Directions:</h3>
Theater seats often display a row and seat number to help theatergoers find their seats. If there are 26 rows (0 to 25) and 100 seats (0 to 99) in each row, write a nested for loop to print out all of the different seat combinations in the theater.

Example output for row-seat information: output each row and seat number on a separate line

<code>0-0</code><br/>
<code>0-1</code><br/>
<code>0-2</code><br/>
<code>...</code><br/>
<code>25-97</code><br/>
<code>25-98</code><br/>
<code>25-99</code><br/>
