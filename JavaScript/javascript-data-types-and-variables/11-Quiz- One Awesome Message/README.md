Here are two awesome messages:

<code>"Hi, my name is Julia. I love cats. In my spare time, I like to play video games."</code>

<code>"Hi, my name is James. I love baseball. In my spare time, I like to read."</code>

Declare and assign values to three variables for each part of the sentence that changes (firstName, interest, and hobby).

Use your variables and string concatenation to create your own awesome message and store it in an awesomeMessage variable. Finally, print your awesome message to the JavaScript console.
